The module needs to:
    - have a class for the board which will have:
        - an init method to create the board from FEN (__init__)
        - a method to print the board (__str__)
        - a method to move a piece
        - a method to undo the move
        - a method to check if the game is over
        - a method to declare outcomes
    - have a class for the pieces which will have:
        - a string for piece colour
        - an int for piece type
            - 0 for w_pawn, 1 for w_knight, 2 for w_bishop, 3 for w_rook, 4 for w_queen, 5 for w_king
            - 6 for b_pawn, 7 for b_knight, 8 for b_bishop, 9 for b_rook, 10 for b_queen, 11 for b_king
