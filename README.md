## Project Overview
This project introduces a novel chess engine designed to offer a challenging yet ultimately beatable opponent for human players. Moving beyond the typical focus on raw strength, this engine incorporates heuristics that emulate human-like thought processes, such as extended 'pondering' over complex positions. My aim is to foster a more enjoyable, engaging, and rewarding human-computer chess experience, addressing the current frustration many players face when confronted by overwhelmingly powerful and "emotionless" AI.

## Features
- Ready to deploy.
- Written in clean code and easily editable.
- Comes with UCI (Universal Chess Interface) support.
- Supports all standard chess rules.
- Written in the robust language, C++.
- Incorporates the latest chess advancements such as NNUEs.

## Technology Used
The engine was made with one main technology, C++17 but uses lots of different ideas/technologies in the background, like [Lichess Bot Hosting](https://github.com/lichess-bot-devs/lichess-bot) and a mini-max style development approach, to make it work.

## Installation

Install the repository, download the latest version of the G++ compiler, open a terminal in the repository directory. Navigate to `/Engine` and compile the `main.cpp` file. You can do this by running the following commands in your terminal:

```bash
g++ -Ofast -march=native main.cpp -o engine
```

### Pre-compiled Binaries
If you do not want to compile the engine yourself, you can download the pre-compiled binaries from the [Releases](https://github.com/atharva-malik/chess-engine/releases/tag/v8.1) page. It has been pre-compiled for `x64` on `Windows`. If you encounter any issues with the pre-compiled binaries, please compile your own version using the instructions above.

### Hosting
To host the engine on Lichess, you can use the [Lichess Bot Hosting](https://github.com/lichess-bot-devs/lichess-bot) repository. Create a Lichess account, then follow the instructions in the repository to set up your bot. Once you have your bot set up, you can place the compiled `engine` executable in the `engines` folder of the Lichess Bot Hosting repository. Make sure to set the correct permissions for the executable in the `config.yml` file. Again, refer to the Lichess Bot Hosting repository for detailed instructions.
