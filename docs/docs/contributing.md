# Contributions
The contribution policy for this project is the same as my other projects. If you want to contribute, please fork the repository and create a pull request. I will review your changes and merge them if they are acceptable. If you have any questions or suggestions, please feel free to open an issue or contact me directly. 

[Here](https://www.dataschool.io/how-to-contribute-on-github) is an excellent guide on how to create pull requests and forks to request changes. I suggest using the addon "Better Comments" on Visual Studio Code as it makes the comments more readable. If you can not use the addon, I have used the following tags to make the comments more readable:

- #todo: This is a todo
- #*: This explains the code
- #!: This is a warning
