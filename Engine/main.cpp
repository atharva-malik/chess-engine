/**
 *  @file main.cpp
 *  @brief Entry point for the UCI-compatible chess engine interface.
 *
 ** This file implements the command handling loop for communicating with 
 ** GUI clients using the Universal Chess Interface (UCI) protocol. It initialises 
 ** the NNUE evaluation engine, processes incoming UCI commands, and delegates 
 ** behavior to relevant components such as move generation, board state 
 ** management, and game control.
 *
 *? Dependencies:
 *? - chess.hpp: Core chess logic and data structures.
 *? - helpers.cpp: Utility functions for command parsing and engine support.
 *
 ** The program logs interactions for debugging and exits gracefully upon receiving
 ** the 'quit' command.
