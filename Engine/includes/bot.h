/**
 *  @file bot.h
 *  @brief Defines the Bot class and supporting evaluation structures for a chess engine.
 *
 ** This header provides the declaration of the Bot class responsible for handling move generation, 
 ** board evaluation, and decision-making within different phases of a chess game (opening, middle, and endgame).
 *
 ** It also defines the PieceTables struct, which contains hand-tuned positional evaluation matrices
 ** for all chess pieces, tailored to reflect strategic concepts like center control, castling, piece activity, 
 ** and king safety across different game stages.
 *
 *! Features:
 *! - Multiple constructors for FEN initialisation and game stage control.
 *! - Heuristics for evaluation using handcrafted piece-square tables and material values.
 *! - Opening book integration using JSON-based storage.
 *! - Static utilities for logging and board visualisation.
 *! - Search algorithms including minimax and negamax with alpha-beta pruning.
 *! - Move ordering and utility functions to assist in efficient decision-making.
 *
 *? Dependencies:
 *? - chess.hpp: Board representation and move generation.
 *? - json.hpp: Parsing of opening book data.
 *
 ** This class forms the core decision-making module of the UCI engine backend.

class Bot{
    /**
     *  @class Bot
     *  @brief Implements a chess engine capable of move evaluation and decision-making across all phases of the game.
     *
     ** The Bot class encapsulates the primary logic and structure required for a UCI-compatible chess engine.
     ** It supports position evaluation, strategic move selection, and integration with an optional opening book.
     *
     *? Key capabilities:
     *? - Position evaluation via piece-square tables and phase-based heuristics.
     *? - Move selection using minimax/negamax with alpha-beta pruning.
     *? - Game phase segmentation: opening (using book), middlegame (multi-threaded), endgame (specialized logic).
     *? - Integration with a JSON-formatted opening book file for deterministic early play.
     *? - Logging utilities for diagnostics.
     *
     *! Construction options:
     *! - Empty constructor initializes default board state.
     *! - FEN-based constructors allow custom game state setup with or without explicit game phase.
     *
     *? Public methods:
     *? - print_board: Static utility for console output of board state.
     *? - get_best_move: Returns the engine’s best move based on the current board and configuration.
     *? - LogToFile: Static logger for recording diagnostic messages.
     *
     *! Internal mechanisms include:
     *! - Evaluation tables for all pieces and game stages.
     *! - Search helpers for move pruning, ordering, and scoring.
     *! - Phase-aware logic to adjust strategy dynamically.
     *
     *? Dependencies:
     *? - Board and Move types from chess.hpp.
     *? - nlohmann::json for opening book handling.
